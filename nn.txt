Grateful for the Opportunity



Dear [Recipient's Name or Team],

I hope this message finds you well.

I’m happy to share that after 10 months of working as an Apprentice at Morgan Stanley, I’ve received confirmation for Full-Time Employment.

It has been an incredible journey so far, and I feel truly grateful to be part of this team under the guidance of Enkesh, Nishat, and Chandra. Over the course of my apprenticeship, I had the opportunity to work across diverse and impactful areas such as Power BI, Snowflake, Interaction Linking using Machine Learning, DevOps, and Proofs of Concept in AI like Context-Based Interaction Search and CRM360.

Each of these projects has been a new learning experience and has helped me grow both technically and professionally. I sincerely thank you for considering me a good fit for the team, and I’m excited to continue contributing with the same dedication and enthusiasm.

Looking forward to what’s ahead.
Thank you once again!

Warm regards,
Ram Praveen Reddy Thumu
